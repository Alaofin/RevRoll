The document contains SQL solutions to four questions related to the performance and activities of installers at RevRoll. Here's a brief summary of each question and its objective:

1. **Installer Bonuses**:
   - **Objective**: Calculate the year-end performance bonuses for each installer based on 10% of the total value of parts they installed. Results are sorted by bonus in increasing order.

2. **Install Derby Points**:
   - **Objective**: Calculate the total points for each installer in the "Install Derby" contest, where points are awarded based on match results (win, draw, loss). Results are ordered by total points in decreasing order and by installer ID in case of ties.

3. **Fastest Install Times**:
   - **Objective**: Find the fastest install time along with the corresponding derby ID for each installer. In case of a tie, the install with the smallest derby ID is chosen. Results are ordered by installer ID in ascending order.

4. **Friday Parts Spending**:
   - **Objective**: Calculate the total spending on parts by customers for installs done on each Friday in November 2023. If there are no purchases on a particular Friday, the total is set to 0. Results are ordered by the week of the month.
